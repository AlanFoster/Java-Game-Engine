Stores the asset name, and any additional information it may wish
to provide within a map. There is no data type specified within
this page, as it is assumed that the same file location, and 
additional information COULD be used for more than one type
of resource. 


NOTE :: When I have time i need to modify xstream to 'prettify'
this xml, so that it doesn't say <map><entry> but instead
<assetlist><asset> for instance
